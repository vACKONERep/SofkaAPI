# E2E Test using Karate for PetStore API

## Description
This repository contains automated tests for the PetStore API (https://petstore.swagger.io/). The tests were created using **Karate**, a tool for testing RESTful APIs. The objective is to test the following scenarios:

1. Add a pet to the store.
2. Query the pet by ID.
3. Update the pet's name and status to "sold."
4. Query pets by status.

The tests are designed to ensure that the API functions correctly in the above scenarios.

## Prerequisites
Before running the tests, you need the following:
- **Karate** installed on your local machine.
- **JDK** (Java Development Kit) version 8 or higher.
- A Maven or Gradle build tool for dependency management (optional).

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vACKONERep/SofkaAPI.git
   cd SofkaAPI
